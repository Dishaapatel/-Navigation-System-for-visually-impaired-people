Project: Navigation System for visually impaired people.

Front-End Technology Python: Using Tkinter module

Back-End Technology

Python 3.9 and some of the modules: • Speech Recognition • Tensorflow • OpenCV • Pyttsx3 • Numpy • Tkinter • Requests • Datetime • pyautogui

The theme of this UI is selected such that as you can see light falling on the ‘Let’s Navigate’ Button, so we kept it that way since out software is going to help blind people to navigate.

If user clicks on “Let’s navigate” button then two Python files “Voice Assistant” and “Object Detection” will start its execution in two different CMD Windows parallel.

If the user Speaks the command ‘Let’s Navigate’ then Object Detection Program will start detecting objects.

• If any obstacle is detected then its relative position with respect to body will be calculated and accordingly move left/right command will be given.
